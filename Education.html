    <h1>MY EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND:</h1>
    <p> • In my two years of college, I had the opportunity to make many new friends and engage in various activities and events. 
          I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems program at Northwest Samar State University, 
          where I am a second-year student. Although I have not yet obtained my degree, 
          I am determined to complete this course and graduate with a major in Information Systems.
          Additionally, I had the privilege of participating in the Mobile Legends tournament during 
          the school's intramurals last year. 
          Lastly, my college experience has been enriching, and I am excited to continue my educational 
          journey and achieve my goal of obtaining a degree in Information Systems.

    <h1>MY EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY:</h1>
    <p>•My educational journey has been incredibly interesting and has had a significant impact on shaping who I am today. From elementary school to college, I have consistently strived to improve myself academically.
        During my elementary days, I had a strong dedication to learning and would often come home early to explore new knowledge. This commitment allowed me to develop an advanced understanding of various subjects.
        In high school, I faced challenges in maintaining my grades due to distractions from friends who enjoyed playing outside. We didn't have phones at that time, which contributed to the distractions. <br>
        Now, in college, I am enrolled in the Information Systems course, which aligns with my career goals. Despite facing difficulties such as financial problems and project proposals, I remain actively involved in activities and hands-on work in the computer lab.
        My educational journey has been a transformative experience, and I am grateful for the opportunities it has provided me to grow academically and personally.</p>
